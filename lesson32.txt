The things I ran out:

When bitcoin cost 13 thousand dollars I was ready to buy it, but I lost my crypto wallet in the mess inside my wardrobe,
I was ran out of time to sell my bitcoins, and I've failed.

Every time I get the salary, I always run out of money to buy a yacht.

When I had an interview in Yandex, I had ran out of ideas to solve some of their task. As a result, I've failed that time

Previous weekends my mom's car accumulator ran out of charge, so, I had to help her with her car.
