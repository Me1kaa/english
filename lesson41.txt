Essay;

	Many people say that after leaving school or university, young people should choose a job or career that they love,
rather than one that pays the best salary. That's a statement I can't to not agree. First of all, money is not a silver
bullet from every problem you have. Secondly, be a prisoner of a job you don't like is the worst thing ever and
I think that's not only my opinion.
	Have you ever noticed that rich people also suffer from apathy, depression and other mental problems?
That's the point that money sometimes can't make you happy. Avoiding that issues are hard work for every one of us,
and choosing the right career, which gives you positive emotional impact, is one of the first steps to your happiness.
It will provide you with targets which you will be trying to reach and develop yourself.
	In the other hand, you can run for money and do stupid, tedious work you don't like. After university,
I also chose the wrong job and was suffering for some period, although the salary was excellent. That gives me
nothing except regrets, and sometimes I think that having a time machine would be an excellent option to sort
the things out in my past, but that's a real-life, not a SCI-FI story.
	But also I can understand myself and people who are choosing such jobs. After university, many people don't
know what they want to do, and they take opportunities grouping by salary. And the negative experience is not always bad.
Sometimes it gives you a hard punch, and you start moving fast, changing different jobs and find the one you love.
	So, as a conclusion, I want to say that ideally, you should choose your occupation during university education
and not run for the money, but if you weren't able to do that this is not the end, try different things.
In the end, you'll find yourself, try and try and try.
