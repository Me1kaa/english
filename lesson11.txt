It is often said that sports coaches ( 1 ) can be strict, but athlete Lance Jordan's
was incredibly hard on him in the year before the Olympic Games. For instance, Lance
(2 )couldn't stay up later than nine, although on his birthday he (3) was allowed to
 watch television until ten as it was a special occasion! Of course, all Lance (4) could think of was going out with his friends in the evening,
 and he (5) could hardly wait for the Games to finish to get back to a normal life. When he complained, his coach just said,
 'Trust me and you'll win gold - you (6) can't lose! And his coach was right. He won a gold medal in the 400 metres in a world record time.
And on the night of his victory Lance (7) was allowed to celebrate
- by staying up until 11 o'clock! 'But no later/ said his coach. 'The World Championships are only two years away.'
