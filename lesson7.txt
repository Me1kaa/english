The villagers warned me what the conditions were like at higher altitudes, and
advised *me* to take enough food for a week. There was some discussion through the day
*as to whether* the snow would arrive before my descent from the mountain, but I never
imagined how hard the conditions would be. In the morning they showed me *how to* get to the track up the mountain.

When the snow started falling it was very light, and I couldn’t decide *whether* to carry on
or go back down. Soon, however, I couldn’t see where to go.

I wondered *whether* to retrace my steps and try to find th e track again, but by the tim e
I decided *that* I should go back, the track had disappeared.

As the snow got heavier I began to realise *that* my life was in danger. Fortunately,
my years in the Andes had taught *me* what to do in extreme conditions. I knew that
there was a shepherd’s hut somewhere on this side of the mountain that I could
shelter in, but I didn’t know *whether* it was nearby or miles away.
